Providing ways for Android app developers to build and test apps that deliver compelling experiences on mobile devices is becoming a major differentiating factor. The first half of this session will focus on Motorola Mobility resources for Android developers and how Motorola’s developer network enables developers to create, test and market their applications — including MOTODEV Studio for Android, Virtual Developer Lab (VDL) and App Accelerator program.The second half of the session, will shift the discussion to focus on application optimization for tablet devices. Having a great user interface is often the difference between an application that sells in Android Market and one that doesn’t. When transitioning an application to tablets, upgrading the look and feel of the interface is a key component to maintaining an engaging mobile experience. Motorola will present the best development tips for creating Android apps that users love on tablets like the Motorola XOOM. You’ll get design and coding tips for the most popular UI patterns for tablets.</fx:description>
